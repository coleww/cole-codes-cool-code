first in series on making weird smartphone controlled toys.

device orientation. x/y/z plane

range of numbers

using range-fit/similar functions to get to 0-1 or 0-127 or 0-255 as is yr wont.

publishing web audio synths to npm. (sidenote)

add event handler to make some rad noise or do other cool things on turn.

video game => direction determined by orientation?
crud app => turn in diffy directions to do something? a 180 turn does ???

OTHER THINGS
video synth FIND A RED=>dissonance to consonance
tap/touch/drag => yes
type => hmm weird
breath flute => tap on screen and blow
shaky drums => has internal bpm, shaking it causes more samples to fire
location drone => different sound for every location on earth!
