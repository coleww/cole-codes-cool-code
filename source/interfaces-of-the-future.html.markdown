this is the state of the art in music production software, and it has a complexity similar to emacs.

if every knob/dialog box in that screenshot was a primitive data type or function, could probably learn Emacs faster than you can learn everything about this thing. PLUS the knowledge and skill you gain coding techno in JS will help you code better in general.
