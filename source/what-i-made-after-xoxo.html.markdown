# What I Made After XOXO
## A month of shipping creative products

Got back from XOXO, inspired, amped up, and ready to crush some code both creatively and indepently. 


met several of my favorite artists, lots of new people. saw lots of awesome stuff being demo'd, and learned about a lot of peoples interesting passions and personal projects.
learned that there are a lot more people interested in doing weird stuff with web audio than i had ever imagined.
as a web dev in SF, tech culture is horrendous. was able to meet some thoughtful people in my area. 
drank a lot of delicious free beer and relaxed and walked around in the sun for 3 days

(when the talks go online, i highly recommend watching the ones by c. spike trotman, mallory ortberg, zoe quinn, and rami ismail)


I had already been feeling pretty productive and confident leading up to XOXO.

 ~2 years coding, new job where i learn stuff every day, a weird tendency every year to wake up between 5-6 am every morning during the summer, THE prime environment to ship a lot of creative product.

 what follows is a list of everything i have made in the month since XOXO ended:
