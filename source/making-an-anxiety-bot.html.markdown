Paul Ford's

what interested me was externalizing the thing. rather tha obsessively repeating the same horrid mantras over and over, confront them directly.


swearing at the thing felt good too! exerted a lot of snarky/angry behavior on a mean bot. not only wasn't bottling up lil anxieties, but getting rid of lil annoyances too!


the tweets taht the bot sends to me are protected, but you can see what i have responded to it:

[source code](http://github.com/coleww/anx...) is up, very simple, just give it a list of things to tweet at you, and it will pick one at random.
