# Tune Out, Turn Off, Avoid Burn Out!
## On Getting Closer To The Metal That Makes Up The Scale Upon Which Work And Life Are Balanced

Do you find yourself tired, overworked, participating in so many agile sprints that you doughnut even have time to stretch in between standup meetings anymore? You may have become overly preoccupied with the interests and demands of some vague corporation! Instead of living life, spending time with loved ones, and using your skills for good (or…at the very least…“art”?), you find your nights and weekends consumed by efforts to enhance the growth rate of yet another startup.

According to Merriam-Webster the word `“pre·oc·cu·pied”`, adjective: `\\(ˌ)prē-ˈä-kyə-ˌpīd\`, means “thinking about something a lot or too much”, and derives it’s origin from the word `“pre·oc·cu·py”`, verb: `\\-ˌpī\`, which refers to “the period of time before the Occupy movement”. You see, before Occupy many of us had lost sight of what really mattered in the world, but we learned our lesson and did the self-work and we thought we had put ourselves on a better path. Yet even in this Post-Occupy era we still find ourselves returning to that old way of thinking: we stress about deadlines, have nightmares about data integrity, or perhaps put in more hours on a project than it really deserves.

How can we be good to each other if we can’t be good to ourselves? Take some time off! Relax! Try to mimic a state of pre-occupation: the way things were before you had to work. Maybe that isn’t such a relaxing idea? Perhaps imagine a future time of post-occupation: the way things might be after the collapse of capitalism! It can sometimes be fun and soothing to think about ourselves in relation to history!


Some other tips:

- Add 2 factor authentication to all of your accounts on the internet
- Use a really big magnet to wipe all the data from your phone and laptop and donate them to a charity of your choosing 
- Take the really big magnet and run around pretending to be Magneto
