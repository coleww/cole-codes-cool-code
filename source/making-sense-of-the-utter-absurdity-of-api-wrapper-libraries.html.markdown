API wrappers! twitter, wordnik, tumblr, whatever.
TEND TO BE absurd to understand
they might not have much documentation beyond a couple examples, presuming that the actual API it wraps has good documentation, and that everything uses the same names.

because it just makes HTTP calls that are RESTful, brings out weirdest meta-programming and functional hacks that people have up their sleeve. 

often means juggling the wrapper docs for config, boilerplate, API docs for what you actually need to pass.
