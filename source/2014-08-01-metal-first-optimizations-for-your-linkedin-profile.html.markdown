# Metal-First Optimizations for your LinkedIn Profile
## JGTTMD! Just Get To The Metal, Dummy!
### -Al Gore*, 1993

In today’s disrupt-or-be-disrupted marketplace it can be quite difficult to find software engineering positions that do not require at least a decade of experience in diving and/or swooping down into the metal. Some employers may even mandate that you acquire proper S.C.U.B.A. certification** before commencing any sort of technical screening which might discuss topics that are merely adjacent to the metal! And this is for supposedly ‘entry-level’ positions!

#### Never fear young developers!

Although the big companies may claim that they want Senior Metallurgists, they are rarely willing to provide the salary, benefits, or proximity from the metal that a veteran Forge-Driven Developer commands and deserves. However with just a few minor optimizations you can make your LinkedIn profile put the Metal-First and get those recruiters’ short attention spans focused on you, You, YOU!

- The Summary: JGTTMD!

This is your cover letter right here, and we all know that nobody reads cover letters except to scan them quickly for words like ‘Google’ and ‘Facebook’. So… Just Get To The Metal, Dummy! And… Keep It Short, Stupid! Make sure that you use the caps lock library as it makes the text more attention grabbing and adds a certain level of ‘pop’ which is exactly what employers and clients are hungry for.

You can also add images of your ‘work’ here, however I recommend that you think of this area as an extension of your MySpace from high school and utilize it as a free backup cloud storage for your important photographs. This strategy has proven quite fruitful in my experience and it is far better than Flickr.

- Endorsements Can Be For A N Y T H I N G

Do I know Ruby on Rails? Of course I do! Would you put ‘excels at google docs spreadsheets’ on your resume? NO! Just get to the point. Are you more forge-driven or mold-driven? Are you a strict metal-first hacker or are you flexible as to your working-distance from the metal? These are the things you should be highlighting and soliciting endorsements for.

As you can see, I am a bit rusty working with foundries, but people generally agree that I hack jQuery and Node pretty frigging close to the metal.

- Use Semantic Categorization


Some social networks forbid you from listing Rails or Node as a language on your profile, but not here! LinkedIn will accept literally any form of input anywhere on their site. That is just their level of commitment to their users.

While I am fluent in many computer speaks, here I am trying to emphasize my passion for hacking on the bleeding edge of the metal that has come to be known as ‘the open web’.

- Be Liberal in Your Definition of ‘Experience’


I do not think that this is a crime… but if it is a crime then I think that Weird Al Yankovich is committing the exact same crime and at least I will be in good company.

Do not be brash and list yourself as CEO or ‘co-founder’ of your fake startup. That is disgusting and is the type of behavior that should be kept to AngelsList***.

- Show Off Your Hobbies Too!

You should take care to spice up your profile so that it reflects your personality. Here I demonstrate my desire to get as close to the metal as possible in all aspects of my work-life balance.

I also state that I am not looking for a job. That is very important. If you put this line on your LinkedIn, recruiters will thirst for you.

##### Why?

‘Not looking for work’ says ‘I work somewhere that gives me interesting problems to solve and pays me well’ which means ‘I am good at code’. In my case I really do not want to hear from recruiters, but that is one of the sacrifices we all make in building our personal brands!

##### Gosh golly,
how much better does your profile look now that you have put the metal first? It’s time to start aggressively adding as many connections as possible so that you can accrue those precious endorsements and recommendations! Why, here is a fellow who would be happy to endorse your skills in the metal arts.

*Al Gore was a popular politician who, in the 1990s, pioneered the use of Adobe Macromedia Shockwave Flash animatics on campaign websites. He is best known for being defeated by Javascript in the 2000 United States Presidential election.

**For insurance and liability reasons, of course. Imagine if a potential hire forgot the base case for a recursive fibonacci solution while whiteboarding flat against the metal inside of the 42-micron danger-zone? Can you imagine it? I shudder at the mere thought of imagining it.

***AngelsList is like CraigsList except that this list was invented by someone named Angel. Or by an angel. No one is exactly clear on this aspect of startup mythology. There’s a hacker news thread about it.
