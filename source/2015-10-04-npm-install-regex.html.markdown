## Never Write Another Dang Regex Again!

Hello reader! At some point in your illustrious and storied programming career you probably read the following quote, and I bet you laughed about it, but also thought back to a time when it was really true for you:

`Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.` - Jamie Zawinski

Never have this problem again.

As you might already know, I'm a pretty big fan of npm. They are literally the only tech company and/or technology that I will ever evangelize to anyone for any reason. 

npm has like, hella packages. I would look up the number, but humans are bad at understanding scale and magnititude, so suffice it to say that it is a hella lot of packages. 

It has recently occurred to me that buried somehwere in the npm registry is a regex for any problem that you might ever have (or, at the very least, some source code or a helper library to get you started). 

### THIS MEANS YOU NEVER HAVE TO WRITE A REGEX AGAIN!

##### PARTY TIME!

You can browse the full list of regex and regex-related packages on this lovely [npm search](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=regex) which as of this writing has 2190 results. It includes lovely regexes for such things as [emails](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regex-email), [urls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regex-url), [phone numbers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phone-regex), [copyright notices](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copyright-regex), [MAC addresses](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mac-regex), [script tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-regex), [emoji](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-regex), [RGB color codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rgb-regex), [CSS classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regex-classname), and  [regexes themselves](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regex-regex).

Perhaps the next time you are confronted with a problem, you will think to yourself "I know, I'll search npm!".
